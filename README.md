## Hi, I'm Paarth! ðŸ’–
Starting at age 5, my tech obsession began by playing PC games with my cousins, leading to endless tinkering wherever I could from then on. That early passion ignited my drive to craft intuitive, satisfying user experiences. Today, as a Vancouver-based Full Stack Developer, I build scalable web and mobile solutions with a laser focus on seamless functionality. I love problem-solving in collaborative teams and quickly mastering new technologies. I'm especially fascinated by Human-Computer Interaction and the potential of Generative AI.

Experienced with: Typescript, PHP, GO, C#, PostgreSQL, ReactJS, VueJS, Laravel, NextJS, FastifyJS, GraphQL, AWS, Docker, Azure.

## Beyond Coding
When I'm not behind the screen, you'll find me exploring trails on backpacking adventures or fueling up at my favourite coffee shop. Let's talk tech over a cup sometime about your next project in need of development!
